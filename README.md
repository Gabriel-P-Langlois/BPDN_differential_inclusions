1)  This repository contains the scripts and functions for the exact 
    homotopy method based on gradient inclusions.

2)  The solvers and functions are in the ./src directory. 
    The gaussian example is in the ./bin directory. 
    The ./results folder contains subidrectories containing several numerical results. 
    These subdirectories contain runall.m files that can be ran from the project directory. 

3)  The script_gaussian_example.m file in the ./bin folder allows for several options
    See the runall.m files in the ./results subdirectories for more information.
    GPL will add some comments later to describe what these inputs are, but it should
    be clear from the runall.m files what they do.

4)  TODO: Discuss the Sparco data...
