1)  This repository contains the scripts and functions for solving
    the basis pursuit denoising exactly, numerically up to machine
    precision, and in a very fast manner.

2)  The solvers and functions are in the ./src directory. 
    The ./results folder contains subdirectories containing several numerical results. 
    These subdirectories contain runall.m files that you run from the project directory. 

WIP: This repository will be updated continually...
