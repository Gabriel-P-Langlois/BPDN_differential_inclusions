May 7th: GPL rearranged the structure of the project repository to something more amenable.
	- 	The least-squares approach does not work... GPL messed up here.
	- 	The rest of the work, however, still stands: the choice of the initial condition in the differential inclusions problem
		is enough to get that the trajectory is one-to-one with the solution of the BPDN problem.
		Since there are active set methods for computing the NNLS problem, it means that we can solve the BPDN problem
		and the BP problem to machine precision. Moreover, the approach also works when the data is rational.

		This is, by itself, a good result.

		There remains, however, two issues: 1) bounding the total number of iterations taken by the algorithm
		and 2) bounding the number of iterations requires for the NNLS problem.

		GPL wonders if Stan Osher approach for the Lasso problem works better in this particular situation...

		- The focus now should be on updating the draft and add the missing details.
		- Also update the homotopy solver to further simplify the NNLS problem.
		- Maybe the paper should be refocused to something theoretical... or show the equivalence


--- Notes about experiments ---

The experiment random_m=500_n=20000_SNR=6 solve the homotopy problem with Gaussian random data design with m = 500 samples
and n=20000 features and a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR=6).

Running the experiment with lsqnonneg takes about ~ seconds.
